Small sizes, designed to invite you to grasp, these are unique pieces carved manually in wood and resin. Their shapes are inspired by both Paleolithic bifaces, the first anthropomorphic statuettes and the contemporary aesthetic of our smart-objects.",

Via this platform, anyone wishing to do so can welcome the Passenger of their choice by contacting their current holder and thus participate in their transmission.",
